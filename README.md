# Relational and Non-Relational Database Design
### Overview
This project highlights how I used both relational and NoSQL databases to manage and analyze large datasets using PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

### Relational Database Design Task 1 – EcoMart (PostgreSQL)
  -	Created a clean, organized database with linked tables (e.g., Sales, Items, Region) to reduce duplicates and speed up performance
  -	Wrote complex SQL queries and added indexing to track sales, inventory, and shipping delays, making queries about 15% faster

### NoSQL Database Implementation Task 2 – EcoMart (MongoDB)
  - Built a flexible MongoDB database for a product catalog with over 38,000 records (cosmetics and groceries)
  - Used indexing to improve performance (up to 90% faster) and cleaned data by converting nested fields into readable arrays
