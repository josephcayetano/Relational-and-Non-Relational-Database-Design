# D597-AllTasks-Relational-and-Non-Relational-Database-Design
### Overview
This project showcases relational and non-relational database design using PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I developed and queried a normalized relational schema and implemented a document-oriented NoSQL database to manage large datasets and support analytical queries.

### Relational Database Design Task 1 – EcoMart (PostgreSQL)
  -	Designed and implemented a normalized relational database (Sales Order, Items, Region tables) to reduce data redundancy and improve performance.
  -	Wrote advanced SQL queries and applied indexing to analyze sales trends, inventory levels, and shipping delays, reducing query execution time by ~15%.

### NoSQL Database Implementation Task 2 – EcoMart (MongoDB)
  - Built a document-oriented MongoDB database to support a dynamic product catalog (cosmetics and groceries), importing over 38,000 records.
  - Enhanced performance by implementing indexing (up to 90% faster) and performed data transformations (e.g., converting nested ingredient fields to arrays).
